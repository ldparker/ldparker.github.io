                <h2> Early Childhood</h2>
                    <p>Born in Calgary and raised in Cochrane until the age of 5, I didn’t know much about what I was leaving behind when my family and I moved down to Saratoga, California for 3 years.</p>
                    <p>Moving from the prairies on the edge of the Rocky Mountains to the Bay Area at such a young age proved to be the single most influential event of my life. From my time spent in California, technology sparked a major role in my life, which I would continue to carry with me to today.</p>
                    <p>I moved to Saratoga, CA at the age of 5, and lived there for the next 3 years—from Kindergarten to Grade 2—so my parents could pursue further education at Stanford. Seeing as this was 1999, the technology industry in Silicon Valley was booming. My dad lasted less than a year at Stanford before he dropped out to join the “Dot-com Bubble.” During my time spent in California I made life-long friends, created some incredible memories, learned to surf and appreciate the outdoors, and perhaps most importantly, was exposed to the upper bounds of success. Living among and meeting so many successful individuals—even when I was so young—created an impression on me and established how I define success. Today, I continue to pursue my vision of success that was crafted from these crucial years.</p>
                    <p>After 3 years in California, my parents decided that Silicon Valley and the Technology industry might not be for them, so we moved back to Cochrane, AB for 2 years—from grade 3 to grade 4. In mid 2004, my Dad was offered an exciting position at an up-and-coming company founded by one of his friends met a few years earlier, and we moved back to California to give Silicon Valley one more shot. I spent my 5th grade again in Saratoga, CA and continued to absorb everything that was around me. These young years are formative for any kid, but to have seen the stark difference between Calgary, AB—driven by natural resources—and Silicon Valley, CA—driven by human resources—sparked what would later become a passion for the technology industry.</p>
                    <p>Grade 5 ended, and so did my parents’ dreams of settling in California. My parents no longer liked what they were doing, and so they quit and we moved back to Cochrane, AB—where I would spend grade 5-grade 12.</p>
