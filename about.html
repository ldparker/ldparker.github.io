                <h2 class="col-md-12">Childhood</h2>
                    <p>Born in Calgary and raised in Cochrane until the age of 5, I didn’t know much about what I was leaving behind when my family and I moved down to Saratoga, California for 3 years.</p>
                    <p>Moving from the prairies on the edge of the Rocky Mountains to the Bay Area at such a young age proved to be the single most influential event of my life. Since my time spent in California, technology has continued to play a major role in my life.</p>
                    <p>I moved to Saratoga at the age of 5, and lived there for the next 3 years—from Kindergarten to Grade 2—so my parents could pursue further education at Stanford University. Seeing as this was 1999, the technology industry in Silicon Valley was booming. My dad finished his year as a visiting PhD student, and soon after entered the tech workforce during the “Dot-com Bubble.” During my time spent in California I made life-long friends, created some incredible memories, learned to surf and appreciate the outdoors, and perhaps most importantly, was exposed to the upper bounds of success. While I didn’t realize it at the time, several of my neighbours were some of the highest-ranking executives at companies such as Google and Yahoo. Living among and meeting so many successful individuals—even when I was so young—created an impression on me and established how I define success. Today, I continue to pursue my vision of success that was crafted from these crucial years.</p>
                    <p>After 3 years in California, the company my Dad was working for started to wind down, and my parents jumped on a new opportunity in their field that was previously put on hold: education. So, we moved back to Cochrane for 2 years—from grade 3 to grade 4. In mid 2004, my Dad was offered an exciting position at an up-and-coming tech company founded by one of his friends met a few years earlier, and we moved back to California to give Silicon Valley one more shot. I spent my 5th grade again in Saratoga, and continued to absorb everything that was around me. These young years are formative for any kid, but to have seen the stark difference between Calgary—driven by natural resources—and Silicon Valley—driven by human resources—sparked what would later become a passion for the technology industry, and self-improvement.</p>
                    <p>Grade 5 ended, and so did my parents’ dreams of settling in California. My parents no longer found the same level of passion in their work that they one did so they quit and we moved back to Cochrane—where I would spend grade 5 to grade 12.</p>

                    <div class="about-ubc">
                    <p>After living on the west coast for the few years I did when I was younger, there was no way I’d pass up an opportunity to live by the ocean again. Obviously that’s easier said than done in Canada—I basically had to choose between Vancouver, and Victoria. UBC, the mountains, and Vancouver’s reputation tipped the scales, so I chose UBC.</p>
                    <p>Other than knowing I wanted to go to UBC I didn’t know much else about my future. I decided to apply to UBC for both Applied Science and Commerce, and hopefully I’d only get in to one faculty; my decision would be made for me. Unfortunately (depending on how you look at it!) I was accepted to both faculties, and after much deliberation made the decision to enter the faculty of Commerce—or the Sauder School of Business. Since then, I’ve completed and am in the process of completing 40 courses, ranging from subjects in animal welfare, to management of information systems, to applied financial markets.</p>
                    <p>While my studies were more than enough to keep me busy, I decided to get more involved at UBC and ran for executive positions on the UBC Ski & Snowboard Club in my second and third years of school. From April of 2013 to March of 2015, I was External PR and Vice President of the club. The Ski & Snowboard Club provided an incredible opportunity for me to reach out and meet tons of people at UBC, but also get some invaluable experience working with businesses and sponsors around Vancouver and Whistler.</p>
                    <p>My passion for technology was put on hold during the first three years of my university career, but reignited in my fourth and final year. I took a finance class that integrated Python—a computer programming language—and finance. This class was more influential to my development as a person and a student more than I ever would have believed; you can read more about that in my projects section of this website. Thanks to this course, I’ve become fascinated with programming, and am currently contemplating a 2-year condensed Bachelor of Computer Science degree at UBC and/or taking a coding boot camp. My goal is to combine my love of business with my passion for using technology to make peoples’ lives better, but how I’ll get there I’m excited to see. So far, this passion has kept me busy with creating and updating this website, which I’m hoping will provide the foundation for the rest of my future programming projects.</p>
