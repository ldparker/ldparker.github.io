                <h4>Climbing</h4>
                <p>From about mid march to late September--and on the occassional nice day during the winter--the North Shore mountains all the way to Whistler present incredible terrain for climbing. Whenver possible, my friends and I will load up a car with climbing and camping gear. Below are some pictures from some of these adventures:</p>

                <h4> Bicycle Touring </h4>
                <p>From May-mid June of 2016, my friend Tanner and I cycled from Vancouver, BC, to the San Diego / Tijuana border. Our trip[ took about 5-6 weeks. We cycled down the coast, making stops along the way in San Francsico, Santa Cruz, Santa Monica, and San Diego. This was both mine and Tanner's fisrt cycling trip! Below is a link to some pictures from our adventures:</p>
